# Europa Clipper Ice Shell Compensation Detection

## Project Overview

This repository contains code for investigating whether NASA's Europa Clipper mission can distinguish between compensated (isostatically supported) and uncompensated ice shell topography on Europa using gravity measurements. The research addresses a fundamental question about Europa's ice shell dynamics with implications for thermal evolution, ocean-surface exchange, and habitability potential.

## Research Question

**Can data from Europa Clipper detect whether Europa's topography is isostatically compensated?**

## Scientific Background

Europa's subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust makes it a prime astrobiology target. Understanding whether the ice shell is in isostatic equilibrium provides crucial constraints on:
- Ice shell thickness and mechanical properties
- Heat flow and thermal evolution
- Ocean-surface material exchange pathways
- Potential habitability conditions

Previous missions (e.g., Galileo) confirmed the ocean's existence but lacked the gravitational measurement precision to detect compensation signatures. Europa Clipper promises dramatically improved precision with uncertainties ~10⁻⁶ for low-degree spherical harmonics (Verma & Margot, 2018).

## Methodology

### Current Implementation (Prototype)

The current Jupyter notebook implements a simplified admittance-based analysis:

1. **Physical Setup**
   - Density contrast ice-ocean: 100 kg/m³
   - Europa radius: 1560 km
   - Clipper altitude: 200 km above surface
   - Synthetic topography: Kaula law scaling (amplitude ∝ ℓ⁻¹)

2. **Gravity Computation**
   - Uncompensated case: Full gravity anomaly from topography
   - Compensated case: ~90% reduction via Airy isostasy
   - Spherical harmonic degrees: ℓ = 2-5

3. **Uncertainty Analysis**
   - Incorporates Clipper measurement uncertainties from Verma & Margot (2018)
   - Computes admittance (gravity/topography ratio) with error bars
   - Tests detectability of compensation signal

### Key Results

- **Degrees 2-4**: Clear separation between compensated and uncompensated models exceeds Clipper uncertainty bounds
- **Degree 5**: Signal approaches noise floor (~93% uncertainty), limiting detection capability
- **Conclusion**: Clipper should detect global-scale compensation but not local/regional variations

## Dependencies

- numpy - Numerical computations
- matplotlib - Plotting and visualization

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook to:
1. Generate synthetic Europa topography
2. Compute gravity anomalies for compensated/uncompensated scenarios
3. Apply Clipper measurement uncertainties
4. Visualize admittance spectra with error bars

## Future Work

### Enhanced Modeling (Planned)
- Implement Pauer et al. (2010) methodology with layered interior structure
- Solve Poisson's equation for realistic mass distributions
- Generate consistent gravity, geoid, and topography fields
- Test multiple compensation scenarios (Airy, flexural, partial)

### Analysis Extensions
- Compute gravity-topography coherence spectra
- Implement geoid-to-topography ratio analysis
- Simulate full Clipper measurement pipeline
- Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation

## Scientific Impact

Successful detection of ice shell compensation would:
- Constrain Europa's internal structure and dynamics
- Inform models of heat flow and tidal heating
- Guide interpretations of surface geology
- Enhance understanding of ocean-surface exchange processes
- Support astrobiology assessments
